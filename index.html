      <h3>Mohammed Jayed Hussain</h3>
      <p> I first started to program during year 7. At first, python was difficult to use
	  so it took a while to get used to it. I only used to program during lesson time so
	  I didnt learn much till the NEA project at year 11 and learnt more during A Levels.
	  Programming was the enjoyable part of computer science for me so I decided to do that
	  for a course in Uni.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Brickbreaker</h3>
    <p>
	TO finish off the bootcamp, I went with a widely known game for the project,
	It consists of 3 classes which are paddle, ball, and bricks. It has an array to
	allow bricks to be removed from the screen. It also has an end screen for if u
	have won or lost.
